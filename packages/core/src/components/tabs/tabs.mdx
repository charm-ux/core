# Tabs

_Tabs_ are a set of layered sections of content that display one panel of content at a time. Each tab panel has an associated tab element, that when activated, displays the panel. The list of tab elements is arranged along one edge of the currently displayed panel. Also known as _pivots_.

<code-bubble>

```html preview
<ch-tabs>
  <ch-tab>Overview</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab>Details</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab>Resources</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab-panel>
    <p>

      Each component is built with accessibility in mind, follows WAI-ARIA guidelines, and undergoes
      rigorous testing to ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.

## Best Practices

**_do_**

- Use on content-heavy pages that require a significant amount of scrolling to access the various sections.
- Be concise on the navigation labels, ideally one or two words rather than a phrase.

**_don't_**

- Don't use on pages which don't scroll.
- Don't use a tab to link to a new page.
- Don't use a tab to link to hidden content.

### Setting active tab

The active tab can be set by adding the `selected` attribute. If no default selected tab is found the first tab will be the selected item.

<code-bubble>

```html preview
<ch-tabs>
  <ch-tab>Getting Started</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab selected>Components</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab>Theming</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab-panel>
    <p>
      Begin your journey by installing our library via npm or yarn. Then import the components you
      need and start building immediately with our sensible defaults.
    </p>
  </ch-tab-panel>
  <ch-tab-panel>
    <p>
      Browse our extensive collection of UI components, each designed with accessibility and
      customization in mind. From simple buttons to complex data tables, we have everything you
      need.
    </p>
  </ch-tab-panel>
  <ch-tab-panel>
    <p>
      Customize the look and feel of components using our theming system. Define colors, typography,
      spacing, and other design tokens to match your brand identity.
    </p>
  </ch-tab-panel>
</ch-tabs>
```

### Using active-id

The `active-id` attribute allows you to programmatically control which tab is selected by specifying the ID of the tab you want to activate.

<code-bubble>

```html preview
<ch-tabs active-id="tab-2">
  <ch-tab id="tab-1">Design</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab id="tab-2">Development</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab id="tab-3">Deployment</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab-panel>
    <p>
      Start with a solid design foundation. Create wireframes and mockups that capture your vision,
      considering user experience and accessibility from the beginning.
    </p>
  </ch-tab-panel>
  <ch-tab-panel>
    <p>
      Build your application using modern frameworks and tools. Implement best practices for code
      organization and testing to ensure maintainability and scalability.
    </p>
  </ch-tab-panel>
  <ch-tab-panel>
    <p>
      Deploy your application to production using CI/CD pipelines. Monitor performance and user
      feedback to continuously improve your product over time.
    </p>
  </ch-tab-panel>
</ch-tabs>
```

## Listen for events

A `tabs-change` event is emitted every time there is a new selection.

<code-bubble>

```html preview
<ch-tabs id="event-demo">

## Accessibility

The tabs can be focused by pressing `Tab` on your keyboard and navigating to the desired tab. Arrow keys navigate between tabs. By default, navigating to a tab with arrow keys will select that tab automatically.

With the `manual-activation` attribute, users need to explicitly press `Enter` or `Space` to select a tab after navigating to it with arrow keys. This behavior may be preferred for complex tab interfaces.

## Manual Activation

By default, tabs are automatically activated when navigated to using arrow keys. If you want to require explicit user activation with Space or Enter keys, add the `manual-activation` attribute.

<code-bubble>

```html preview
<ch-tabs manual-activation>
  <ch-tab>Security</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab>Performance</ch-tab>
  <ch-tab>Accessibility</ch-tab>

      We follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure our components are accessible to all users. Each
      element supports keyboard navigation, screen readers, and includes appropriate ARIA
      attributes.
