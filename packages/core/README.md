# Charm Core

Charm Core is a collection of accessible, themeable Web Components built with Lit. It provides the primitives you need to ship consistent UI across frameworks while keeping bundle sizes lean and opting into only the pieces you use.

## What you get

- Headless-first components: extend or style the primitives without fighting baked-in opinions
- A curated set of UI components (accordion, button, dialog, menu, tabs, toast, etc.) implemented as standards-based custom elements
- Built-in accessibility patterns for focus, keyboard navigation, and ARIA
- Design-token driven theming with sensible defaults and a utility-first CSS layer
- Framework-agnostic usage: drop into plain HTML or integrate with React, Vue, or any modern build tool
- First-class docs, stories, and test harnesses to keep components predictable and stable

## Installation

Use your preferred package manager:

```bash
pnpm add @charm-ux/core
# or
npm install @charm-ux/core
# or
yarn add @charm-ux/core
```
