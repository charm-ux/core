title: Version Management
---

Charm uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to assist with versioning and change management. Engineers will use Changesets to generate a changeset with each PR. At release time, Changesets will generate a changelog from all changesets since the last release.

## Usage

- Complete your work on a branch.
- Stage and commit your changes.
- Run `pnpm changeset`. Changesets will prompt you to select which packages have changed.
- For each package that contains changes, follow the prompts to generate an appropriate changeset:
  - **Change type** - select the correct [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) change type:
    - `Patch` - backwards-compatible bug fixes
    - `Minor` - backwards-compatible added functionality
    - `Major` - incompatible API (aka "breaking") changes
  - **Describe changes**
    - Craft a human-readable message following our guidance in [Describing changes](#describing-changes).
- Changesets will create a markdown file in `.changeset/` with a randomly generated name.
- Review and edit the changeset file if needed to improve the description.
- Stage and commit the changeset file.
- Create your PR, which now includes a changeset file.

## Describing changes

Writing a good changelog is essential to keeping our users informed and up-to-date with the latest changes in our packages.

A well-crafted changelog can make a big difference in user experience, so it’s important to get it right. Here are some tips on how to write a good changelog comment:

- A change should be brief and to the point, no more than one line long.
- If changes were made to a component, prefix your change comment with `[ComponentName]`.
- Use consistent phrasing:
  - `Added` for new features.
  - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
  - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
  - `Removed` for now removed features.
  - `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
  - `Bumped <package> from x.x.x to x.x.x` for dependency updates.

Remember: changelogs are for _humans_, not machines.
